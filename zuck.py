Important: __You must have already accepted your offer for your verified status to be granted!__** 

After sending this, a moderator will review this and I will let you know when your access has been approved, 
or if further verification is required. 

If you need further assistance, please type `$%s dm_mods` so I can send someone your way. You may choose to send a 
custom message to the mods by typing said message right after `$%s dm_mods`.
